Before I ever started reading on a Kindle, I hated reading books.

It wasn't the reading part that I hated, but more about how uncomfortable holding books got after about an hour of so. Anything larger than standard sized paperback novel became awkward to hold after 30 minutes of reading, and no matter which way I hold the book (sitting down, lying on a bed, upside down, etc.) it just never felt right.

The part I really hated was how inconvenient it is to carry books around. Any book bigger than a paperback couldn't fit in my pockets, and in a school backpack it has a tendency to be easily damaged due to it being shuffled around a lot in daily usage.

Procuring books was also a hassle because library books you could only borrow for a certain amount of time (I prefer owning books), and the nearest bookstore was on the other side of the town.

### Then came the Kindle

My parents bought me a Kindle Touch the summer right before my junior year of high school after I convinced them it would really help me out a lot at school. Once I unboxed it I was amazed at how different the device was, considering I never owned a e-reader before. The screen felt magical because it looked and felt more like paper than a digital screen.

I configured the Kindle with my Amazon account, and loaded it up with a whole bunch a books I procured from all around the internets; I love how there's so many classic, public domain books available out there, and the massive collection of books available for sale on the Amazon Kindle store. Ever since then I started reading a whole lot of books *just for the fun of it*, and it made reading school-related books much easier with its built in note-taking feature and instant Wikipedia lookup. 

A cool feature that I like a lot on the Kindle was how you can tap a word in the book for a few seconds and it brings up the definition of the word in a pop-up window. To me this was a mind-blowing feature that forever changed the way I read anything that I physically hold in my hands; sometimes I have a habit of doing this in a real book or a newspaper.

The best part about a Kindle, or any other e-reader in the market, is how it can store so many books in something the size of a paperback novel. I fits comfortably in the tiny second compartment in my backpack, and in some cases I have actually managed to fit it in my pocket (sitting down comfortably with it in my pocket is another matter). 

The Kindle Touch has 4GB of storage, 3GB being usable, which means that I can hold around 3,500 books in there if I wanted to - more than I could ever carry in my backpack.

### It's all about the content, not the physical medium

I find it weird when people talk about how they prefer paper books over e-readers due to the particular "feel" that only paper books have. I understand that people have their own preferences, which is completely fine, but when people say that they prefer the reading experience to include "the smell of classical parchment with a touch of hickory", I find it completely ridiculous.

To me, all I care about when I'm reading is the content of the books being displayed right in front of me how I want it, when-and-wherever I want it.

That, is the reason why I enjoy reading on the Kindle.
