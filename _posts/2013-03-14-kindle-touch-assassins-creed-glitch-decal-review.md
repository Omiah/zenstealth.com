A few weeks ago I picked up a very cheap quality clip-on LED book light at the local dollar store so I could read my Kindle in dark. I tried to attach the light to it, but the very flimsy metal clips that hold up the light ended up scratching the top bezel (and it wouldn't even hold the light in place). Since seeing scrathes all over my Kindle distracted me everytime I tried to use the device, I decided to get a skin for it, and after much searching I found this awesome Assassin's Creed themed one:

<figcaption>This book is surprisingly good for a book that's based off of a videogame.</figcaption>

It was the first time I bought a skin from [DecalGirl](http://www.decalgirl.com/), and I really liked how easy it was to apply the skin to the Kindle, and to readjust it since. I actually [bought the skin from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083MQZ2O/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0083MQZ2O&linkCode=as2&tag=z0ad-20) - it was a lot cheaper and the shipping was included with the other stuff I bought from there.

While I am very glad I don't have to shell out $130 bucks for Paperwhite now, I still wish my Kindle Touch came with a built-in backlight and a higher-resolution screen.
