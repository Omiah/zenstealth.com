title: A Nike+ Importer for Garmin
---

My little weekend project this weekend was
[Fatigue](http://github.com/holman/fatigue), a tiny bit of rubygem that imports
your Nike+ run history into Garmin Connect.

Like many others, I presume, I had a few lovely years on Nike+ but recently
switched over to a Garmin Forerunner 405CX. It's like leveling up your running:
the GPS mapping with Garmin Connect is a really compelling way to visualize
your runs. I didn't want to leave my hundreds of logged miles behind, though.

Run `fatigue` and it'll import your old runs from Nike+. More installation and
usage information [can be found on GitHub](http://github.com/holman/fatigue).

On a technical sidenote: I had a fun time using [Readme Driven
Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)
and [TomDoc](http://tomdoc.org) on it. I've found I really dig using both of
those development mentalities; give 'em a shot and see if they work for you,
too.
