title: My Favorites From Rails Rumble 2010

This year's [Rails Rumble](http://railsrumble.com) just finished. It's a 48-hour
sprint for small teams to whip up a Ruby on Rails app. As expected, the apps
this year were even more gorgeous, more polished, and more amazing-er than last
year. I didn't get to participate this year, but you better believe I can
armchair quarterback my favorites to you.

There's about five million apps this year that I was impressed with, but here's
a couple that I was *really* impressed with, in no particular order. I
definitely encourage you to [browse the whole
list](http://railsrumble.com/teams) of teams; there's a lot of interesting apps
tackling some unique problems in there.

Remember... all of these were done in 48 hours or less, which is kind of
insane.

##[Boarrd](http://board.r10.railsrumble.com)

Boarrd is an app that I've wanted to do for some time; it's basically a status
board that lets you set up self-contained widgets on a page. Great design, and
they have 18 widgets to start out with (ranging from Flickr streams, to Twitter
searches, to GitHub project snapshots). Super easy to use, and something that
doesn't seem all too hard for them to ferociously build out new widgets into
the future.

##[Splendid Bacon](http://splendidbacon.com)

Splendid Bacon's pretty splendid. Simple project tracker somewhat akin to 
[Cultured Code's status board](http://culturedcode.com/status). It works with
GitHub post-receive hooks, too, which makes it probably the hottest thing since
sliced butter.

##[Owe Me Cash](http://omecash.r10.railsrumble.com)

Keep track of who owes you what. Simple. Basically I fancy myself a mobster
sometimes, and sometimes you need to break a few kneecaps.

##[Playbill](http://playbill.r10.railsrumble.com)

Playbill's a quick way to find out what's going down in your city of residence
tonight. Cool design, one text field, embedded maps, what's not to like?
Nothing, that's what. Nothing's not to like.

##And a bunch more.

The Rails Rumble (and other blitzkrieg app events like it- nearly every language
and framework has one now) is just fun to watch. It's fun to be *excited* about
web development sometimes. These cats built some cool apps in **two days**,
some of which will go on to become full-fledged apps or businesses. That's
*awesome*.

Sure, a button may not work, or the design may not be up to snuff, or there may
not be the feature you want in a particular app. None of that matters in
competitions like these. It's the journey we should applaud.

And if you're still some sort of bitter internet commenter after all this,
well, shut the fuck up, lace up your boots, and step in the ring next year. :)

Cheers! And don't forget support your favorites on [October
21](http://railsrumble.com), when the round of public voting starts.
