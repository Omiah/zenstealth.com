Learning anything is easy. Internalizing it is difficult.

Something I've found myself doing in my last few projects is to steal ideas
from other projects. Not actually "stealing", of course, but browsing your
favorite projects and developers and stealing *concepts* from them. Design
patterns.  Refactoring methodologies. How does Chris deal with command-line
arguments in [hub](http://github.com/defunkt/hub)? How does Wayne transition
between shell scripting and Ruby in [rvm](http://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm)?
Anything that conceptually requires you to come out of auto-pilot programming
mode and think, "hey, how do I actually do this?" is a great place to start.

Once you reach that point, sure, you could google a blog post to get the
answer. But by "stealing" it from someone else, you achieve two things:

1. You form a mental connection between your concept and that specific project.
2. You acquire "ownership" in that concept.

"Acquiring ownership" in something you "steal" is counter-intuitive, but think
about it: you spend the necessary time to understand the concept, and then you
apply it to your own problem domain. The mental act of doing that can be an
intensely satisfying process. Once that bell clicks, you'll start understanding
*why* the author may have refactored that method, or *why* they needed a
separate helper class.

Don't get me wrong; hammering things out on your own is great. That's almost an
entirely different class of learning, and it works well in the majority of
cases. But sometimes learning others' best practices is the quickest way to
enlightenment- not in terms of fixing your problem at hand, but of
substantially *understanding* the forces involved.

By seeing how others have tackled your problem, reaching the point of your own
personal understanding, and then reshaping it to fit within your viewpoint, the
concept then becomes "your" concept and you then have it in your pocket for
your next project. It may be just another word for "learning", but as soon as I
thought of it in this concrete, compartmentalized fashion — *Oh, this is just
like that inheritance strategy I stole from Homebrew in my other project a few
months back* — my ability to retain knowledge has gone way up.

Once you've reached that level of internalization, that difficult concept
becomes just another concept you can auto-pilot.
