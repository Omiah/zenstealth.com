title: I Liked It When Quick Bars Got Me Drunk
---

Twitter pushed an update for Twitter for iPhone yesterday that mostly centered
around the new "Quick Bar". The Quick Bar is a new technological innovation
that brings the power of a business plan to Twitter, Inc.

With this new update, I can finally forfeit that additional one-tenth of my
screen real estate I've been meaning to shed. A beautiful five-tweet
vertically-stacked display can miraculously, at just the click of an AppStore
update button, turn into four tweets. Or three! I can also gain an ever-present
UI element constantly informing me about mysterious subjects like "Friday" or
"blackpeoplemovies" or "Donald Trump". Sometimes, if I'm really lucky, it will
inform me about a really neat product from a company that is *so* neat that the
company needs to pay Twitter money to help promote it.

How does Twitter gain such technological insights into this market? Is it the
one developer they hire to work on the Mac, iPhone, and iPad apps? Is it
because that one developer only tweets every twenty days? Is it because, even
though that one developer is strapped for time, he usually makes good UI
decisions and this is very clearly a top-down example where Twitter executives
wanted to insert their Monetary Acquisition Strategy into their popular product
regardless of how horrendously misguided the implementation was? I'll let you
decide! They're all just so exciting!
