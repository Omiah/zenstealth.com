My friend Steve Chanin just launched [How I Work](http://how-i-work.com), a
pretty nifty new site that collects a bunch of screencasts about developer
tools, workflows, that sort of thing. He suggested I do a quick little
screencast, so I did, and everyone ran for their lives.

I decided to do one on some of the tools I use most in my day-to-day
interactions with the rest of GitHub: [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com), my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles), and
[boom](https://github.com/holman/boom). By combining all of these together, we
can successfully make your company's chat room super inefficient. Apply some
programming and boom, you're suddenly **automating inefficiencies**.

[Check it out](http://how-i-work.com/workbenches/29-automating-inefficiencies)
on How I Work (along with the bunch of other screencasts going up there!), or
check out the conveniently-embedded video here:
