title: How to Discover Your Music
---

We finally figured out how to sell music online. Everyone knew that DRM was
insane, everyone sort of figured that the general public would buy music more
often than steal it, and iTunes came by and demonstrated both. Now people are
buying a lot of music online. Cool. Problem solved.

There is a war going on for your music discovery. For years we've had the iTunes
model: first, figure out what the hell you're interested in, and then you can go
to the iTunes Store, click on an album, and then hear a thirty second sample.
Maybe click around for another thirty second sample, and then click! You buy
those songs. Or maybe the whole album. And then you own those digital bits.
Cool. Problem solved. I mean, it's solved for a few days until we all figured
out that the process sucks. But we had to live with it.

Music discovery is the last thing to conquer. How can we show you, the user,
which songs you'd love to listen to? How can we involve your friends in those
recommendations? How about the general public? How can we get independent
artists in the mix?

There have been a lot of companies — big and small — attacking this process over
the last decade. Amazon, Last.fm, Spotify, Rdio, Like.fm, Lala, Rhapsody,
Grooveshark, Pandora, iLike, eMusic, The Hype Machine, Slacker... it's really a
stupendous amount. Some crashed and burned, some enjoyed tepid mainstream
success, some retained a small but passionate userbase.

And then Apple decides to launch Ping.

## Ping

Apple's Ping has gotten people talking. It's a pretty large effort: in the realm
of tiny, gradual growth music startups, Apple had to scale up their service to
support [one million full-fledged user
accounts](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/09/03ping.html) in two days, with
the potential of Ping to be eventually used by the 160 million overall iTunes
users. It's a technical feat, to be sure.

That said, the
[buzz](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13526_3-20015453-27.html?tag=contentMain;contentBody)
on the street [appears](http://twitter.com/beep/status/23065624092) to be
[lukewarm](http://twitter.com/al3x/status/23082434122). It may just be the nerdy
crew I follow on Twitter and Hacker News are too jaded in life that they scoff
at Ping out of mainstream spite. But I think it's safe to say that the initial
reaction was less than stellar.

## Making a Better Ping

It gets you thinking: how should Ping have been launched? Why do people dislike
it? More importantly, what cool shit did Apple ignore that should have been in
there from the start?

I used to be a steadfast believer in Jobs' usual comment: people may want to rent
movies, but people want to *own* their music. I still think that's true, except in
the case of music discovery. When I'm trying out new music, when I want to
browse what my friends have been listening to, when I just want to listen to
someone's random playlist... in all of those scenarios I'm fine with paying a
monthly fee in order to get full access to streaming every song I want, on
demand.

I've come to think Ping should have been more like [Rdio](http://rdio.com) and
less like iTunes. In fact, that's what I've decided my music setup will be for
the foreseeable future: all of my "main" music is in iTunes, all of my music
discovery is handled by Rdio.

Rdio does a few things really well: on login I get a snapshot of what my friends
have been listening to (above). I can also browse their playlists and make my
own. More importantly, I pay a small monthly fee and I can stream everything on
the site, without incessant 30-second limitations, without locked-in walled
gardens. I've already found a number of new artists in the last few months that
I would never have otherwise heard of. I have a somewhat less favorable outlook
on Ping's ability to deliver that.

## Apples and Labels

So why isn't Ping more like Rdio, or Spotify, or the multitude of other social
music networks with good ideas? Two reasons: Apple, and Labels.

### Apple

[Apple doesn't understand the
Internet](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/apple-online/). This could be made no
clearer than when Ping launched on iTunes and on iPhone (and presumably soon
enough, on iPad) only. If you're trying to make a social network for music, you're
cutting the legs out from under you if you take away the one sharing option people
understand: URLs. Taking it out of the browser means it's a walled garden. Yes,
there are ways to link to individual Ping pages through really gnarly-looking
URLs, but most people won't understand how to do that in the first place (not to
mention scores of bookmarklets, browser plugins, and other sharing niceties aren't
present in iTunes). Apple has a funny idea of what a social network is.

### Labels

I think the other elephant in the room is music labels. Apple's at a
disadvantage: they're big enough to freak out the old guys in boardrooms across
Hollywood. Startups get more lenient terms because of smaller marketshare and
less potential for disaster. This is why Apple's struggling to even get [one
minute previews](http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/65684) of songs on
iTunes. Any big changes Apple wants to make to the industry is going to be
fought viciously from these guys. Startups though? Do what you want. It puts
Apple in a rather stagnant position.

## Discovery

Ping doesn't cut it in its current form. Inviting people to share their musical
tastes and building a social platform on 30 second sound bites is just an
extension of the iTunes Store, not a novel way to explore your own potential
musical tastes. And it's a bit of a bummer... a network with as much pull and
draw as iTunes could have been really killer.

I think we'll get there eventually. Until then, explore some of the other
smaller players... they're the ones that will bring you the goods until Apple
and the labels wrap their heads around the internet.
