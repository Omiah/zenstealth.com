This is the post where a person, after switching from their previous bloated CMS to the new lightweight hotness that is [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), would write about how awesome it was to do so, and how they liken it to having switched from a [Ford Model T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T) to a [Tesla Roadster](http://www.teslamotors.com/roadster/gallery) (that may be a slight exaggeration). 

For me it was absolutely like that; before I discovered Jekyll, I used Wordpress. I spent around one whole summer to manually install Wordpress, deal with [php_safe_mode](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=php%20safe_mode%20nearlyfreespeech), find the right themes/plugins, and make sure the whole thing was secure before I decided I absolutely don't want to deal with all of that just to blog.

### Then Came Jekyll

The first post I remember about Jekyll that I consciously came across was Paul Stamatiou's "[How To: WordPress to Jekyll](http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-wordpress-to-jekyll)" post - that was the post convinced me to switch to Jekyll. Since he's a much better writer than me, I'll let him describe in detail about what it was like to switch to jekyll and the many benefits of switching to it.

Instead, I'll write down the steps that I took to convert my website to Jekyll.

### The Process

1. Try out Wordpress
2. Get frustrated at Wordpress
3. Switch to a single one page HTML site
4. Try to add more pages while synchronizing HTML structure
5. NOPE
6. Discover Jekyll
7. Discover Git
8. Fork off Zach Holman's [beautifully designed site](http://zachholman.com/)
9. Wrote my first post
10. Put off website for a year due to life events
13. Become inspired to blog again
11. Discover Bootstrap by Twitter
12. Add Bootstrap to site
14. Add final layout changes - make things look real good
15. Write out this post
16. ???????
17. PROFIT!!! (Not really)

### That's about it really.
