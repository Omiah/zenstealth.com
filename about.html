<h2>Who are you, and what do you do?</h2>
<p>My name is Adith Radityo, and I'm a high school student. I like to experiment with code and web design in the brief moments of spare time that I have in my hectic school life. I love four things: technology, science, minimalism, and indie rock. </p>

<h2>What do you plan to do with your life?</h2>
<p>I don't quite know yet. In contrast to the stuff that the consumerist culture I live in wants me to do (buy a lot of stuff, get into debt, work so you can buy more stuff, repeat until death), I plan to get a job that I enjoy doing and pays just enough for me to live my life comfortably in a <a href="http://www.tumbleweedhouses.com/">small house</a> that is filled all sorts of technology (obviously).</p>

<h3>Caution: very geeky stuff up ahead.</h3>

<h2>What kind of hardware do you use?</h2>
<p>Right now I use an old <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook/stats/macbook-core-2-duo-2.0-white-13-mid-2007-specs.html">2007 MacBook</a>. While it might not be as powerful as a MacBook Pro (or even a current generation MacBook), it gets the job done and does it better than any PC I have ever used. Even though I don't like PCs that much, right now I'm in the process of building one from scratch so I can play all my Windows only games.</p>

<h2>And what about software?</h2>
<p>I love using <a href="www.apple.com/macosx">Mac OS X</a>, and I like to experimenting with Linux time to time with <a href=http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. I carry a portable installation of Ubuntu with me on my 8GB USB drive for emergencies -  I'm a bit paranoid about using other people's computers. The only time I would ever use Windows is when I'm forced to use it (like on some school computers), or when I want to play my Windows only video games.
<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.com/">Firefox</a> is my browser of choice, because it's still a lot more customizable than <a href="www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>. I love tweaking Firefox to get it just the way I want it to - here is a screenshot of <a href="/media/firefox.png">my current Firefox config</a> right now. As you can see, it maximizes the usage of vertical space the fullest extent possible.</p>
<p>I use <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> to manage my code, and I use <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> to store my repositories. <a href="https://github.com/zenstealth/zenstealth.com/">Here is the repository for this website</a>, in case you're interested.</p>

<h2>What would be your dream setup?</h2>
<p>My dream setup would be a computer chip installed into my brain which uses the optic nerve to display a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-up_display">HUD (Head-up Display)</a> right in front of me. It would be hooked up wirelessly to the internet, and be powered by the human body itself. I also want some robotic arms and legs.</p>
