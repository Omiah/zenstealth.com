<h2>Who are you, and what do you do?</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Adith Radityo, and I am a high school student who likes to experiment with programming and web design when I'm not busy with school-related stuff.</p>
<p>I like five things: technology, open source, science, minimalism, and indie rock. </p>
<p>You can find me on various social networks by using the links to the left over there.</p>

<h2>What kind of hardware/software/etc. do you use?</h2>
