<p>I hear you are going canoeing on your birthday, so I got you a <strong>picture</strong> of a cake shaped like a canoe that I found on the internets. Sorry that's not a real cake; there is no way I can bake a cake that good. I hope you enjoy it though.</p>

<h3>May the rest of your day be filled with joy and happiness.</h3>
