There's plenty of great [technical writeups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) and [non-technical writeups](http://tomayko.com/writings/rest-to-my-wife) on REST. In short, REST is one way to model and present your data to your users in a consistent, logical fashion that lends itself to being accessible humans, machines, and your own developers. (I don't know if I just called developers neither human nor machine, but let's go with it.)

There's a number of great technical reasons to move to an architecture like REST. In fact, there's a number of great reasons to implement SOAP, XML-RPC, or similar architecture on your app, the distinctions being less relevant for this post. Instead, let's talk about humans being just another RESTful client.
