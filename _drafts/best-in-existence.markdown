iPad apps are not just best-in-class; a lot of them are best-in-existence.

It's a ridiculous, bold claim; I know. But after spending today with the newest addition to my computing family, I think the core reason as to why I feel so excited about the iPad is that a lot of the apps are literally the best in the world.

This needs some examples.

## Photos

One of the apps I was most looking forward to trying out was the native Photos app by Apple. I've dutifully spent the last year and a half cultivating and pruning my iPhoto library, identifying Faces and Places, and splitting photos into Events. I always liked the idea of splitting my photography that way; before Faces I was manually tagging people in my photos and creating smart albums based on those tags. The problem is I never found iPhoto '09 all too great, specifically in the performance realm. My library of 4,000-some photos isn't outlandish, but it's certainly not small, either. That many photos always slowed Events, Faces, and especially Places to a crawl, consuming RAM happily as it did so. Great idea, but the implementation just wasn't that great.

Then I saw the iPad demos. After some initial sluggishness as iPad cached my Event thumbnails, my experiences mirrored what Apple had advertised: the Photos app is *really, really fast*. It's almost insultingly fast, considering my beefy Core 2 Duo iMac should theoretically run circles around the iPad. Even if the performance was comparable, the iPad's UI wins out- the Places map is pretty stunning and is a completely different experience than on a Mac. Pinching photo stacks in and out is another example. In a few minutes it was clear that the Photos app was so much better than iPhoto '09 that I decided I'll be doing all my photo browsing on my iPad, even if my iMac is within arms' reach. The Photos app experience is unlike anything else, period.

## Maps

The other *oh shit* moment I had in the first half hour of playing with iPad was the native Maps app. It's basically a port of Maps on iPhone, but it certainly doesn't *feel* that way. It's literally an experience that can't be described; pinch-zooming in and out on such a huge display is almost like a game in and of itself. It's fluid, effortless, and *fun*. And believe me, having fun on a mapping application is the last thing I thought I'd be saying. But the hardware, UI, and design all come together in such a great package that I can't find myself getting anywhere else.
