<p>For my senior year project, I was inspired by <a href="http://google.com/glass">Google Glass</a>.</p>

<p>I bought a MyVu solo, and I had  Raspberry Pi lying around, so I put the two together, and now I have a wearable computer of my own.</p>

<p>I played Minecraft while I was presenting my project.</p>

<p>How awesome was that?</p>
