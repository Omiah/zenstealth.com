Description
-----------

Here is the source for my website. It's a simple [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) powered blog that's initially based off Zach Holman's [Left](https://github.com/holman/left) theme, but then I did some major changes to it. It uses a modified version of the [Bootswatch Cyborg](http://bootswatch.com/cyborg/) theme.

If you want to clone this website, please remember to delete all my posts and my other stuff like Google Analytics.
